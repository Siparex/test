##  Overview

The Test project is a node.js office add-in developed with Express server initiation in app.js, managing dependencies through package.json, and essential library requirements in requirements.txt. This software serves static files including HTML pages, validates JWT tokens, provides secure SSL communication, and handles API endpoints for user data retrieval. In essence, the Test project is a robust office add-in enabling secure communication, user authentication, and efficient data handling to streamline digital workflows.

##  Features

|   |    Feature          | Description                                                                                         |
|----|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**   | This project uses Node.js with Express as the primary server-side framework, serving static files and API endpoints. It also integrates Office Add-in and Webpack for development and build processes. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**    | The codebase utilizes ESLint and Prettier for consistency. Typescript is used for type checking. Packages like office-addin-lint help maintain the Office Add-in standard. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation**   | Minimal documentation exists, mostly found within source files, focusing on app functionality and setup. No clear readme or project wiki. |
| üîå | **Integrations**    | Key dependencies include Office-JS for creating Office Add-ins, Webpack and related tools for development, Express for server implementation, and MSAL-browser for authentication. |
| üß© | **Modularity**      | The code is reasonably modular with distinct components such as 'app.js' handling server setup, 'package.json' managing project dependencies, and specific functionality split within Express endpoints. |
| üß™ | **Testing**         | The project utilizes Jest for unit testing, along with Supertest for API testing, and ESLint and Prettier for linter checks. No integration or acceptance tests documented. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**     | The Node.js server and Express are known for good performance, but the specifics depend on how well-optimized individual endpoints are coded and resources (like database connections) are managed. |
| üõ°Ô∏è | **Security**        | SSL encryption is used for secure communication, but access control measures and JWT validation need further analysis within individual Express endpoints. |
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**   | Project has a large set of external libraries and frameworks, including 'Express', 'Webpack', 'Office-Addin', 'MSAL-browser', and numerous dev and build tools. |

| [app.js](app.js)                     | Initiates Express server in app.js. Sets up middleware like cookie-parser, logger, and static file serving. Implements API endpoints for user data retrieval and serves static files like HTML files. Validates JWT tokens and uses SSL for secure communication. |
| [package.json](package.json)         | Manage and configure your office add-in project with ease using package.json. It contains essential scripts for building, development, validation, and debugging the add-in, while managing its dependencies.                                                     |
| [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) | The requirements.txt file in this repository outlines essential dependencies for running the application written in JavaScript. It enables efficient installation and management of required libraries using package managers like npm or pip.                    |
